# Competitive Programming Journey

## About Me

- I have recently started solving competitive programming problems to sharpen my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- My goal is to solve at least one problem per day, consistently improving my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Platforms

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Goals

- Solve **one problem per day** to maintain consistency.
- Improve my problem-solving speed and efficiency.
- Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Participate in online contests to test my skills under time constraints.

## Repository Structure

- This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems.
- The structure is as follows:
  ```
  /hackerrank  # Solutions from HackerRank
  /codeforces  # Solutions from Codeforces
  /leetcode    # Solutions from LeetCode
  ```
- Each solution includes:
  - Problem description (if applicable)
  - My solution in various programming languages (primarily C)
  - Explanation of the approach (if needed)

## Progress

- I will update this repository regularly with my daily problem-solving activities.
